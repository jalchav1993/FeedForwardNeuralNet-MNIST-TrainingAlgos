TODO:
1: This uses a propriatary FFNN interface. Will fork this repository with the FFNN I coded so both are part of the same project.
2:  Training set augmentation, Test set augmentation and testing by committee
3.  L2regularization
4.  Momentum
5.  Optimizing parameters (learning rate, hidden layer sizes)
6.  Dropout
7.  Adversarial training
8.  Adaptive learning rate
9.  Using the remainder of the training set as unlabeled data
